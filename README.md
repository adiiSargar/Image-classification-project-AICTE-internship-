This project involves creating a machine learning model to classify vehicle images, specifically distinguishing between cars and trucks.
The goal is to develop an accurate model for vehicle recognition, which can be useful in applications like autonomous driving, traffic management, and automated vehicle identification.
The project uses two approaches: deep learning with transfer learning using the MobileNet model and traditional machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Logistic Regression. 
The dataset used is a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes images of cars and trucks.
For the deep learning approach, I fine-tune a pre-trained MobileNet model to classify images into two categories: cars and trucks. In the traditional machine learning approach, I extracted features from the images (such as pixel values) and apply classifiers like SVM or Logistic Regression for the classification task. The results show that both methods were able to classify the vehicles effectively, but the MobileNet model outperformed the traditional machine learning models in terms of accuracy.
In conclusion, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning with pretrained models like MobileNet for vehicle classification. This approach provides higher accuracy and better generalization, making it a more reliable solution for real-world applications in vehicle recognition and similar fields.
